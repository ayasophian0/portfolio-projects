# Yavuz Altun | Data Analyst

Hello! I’m Yavuz — a Data Analyst with a unique background in journalism and digital media, now fully dedicated to the world of data. I love turning raw information into meaningful insights that help businesses and organizations make smarter, more human-centered decisions.

Today, I combine that experience with technical expertise in **SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI**, and **Machine Learning** to deliver insights and solutions across a variety of domains.
